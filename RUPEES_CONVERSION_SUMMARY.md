1. **All API responses now return amounts in rupees**
2. **All API requests should send amounts in rupees**
3. **No conversion needed on frontend** - amounts are directly in rupees
4. **Display amounts as-is** - no division or multiplication required

### Razorpay Integration
- Razorpay still requires amounts in paise
- Conversion happens automatically in the backend (amount * 100)
- Frontend doesn't need to handle paise conversion

### API Changes
